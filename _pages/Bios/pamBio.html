    <p>I was born in 1982, the same year that the Times Magazine selected Personal Computer as "Person of the Year".<br/>
        In my family, it is said that I learned to type my name on the keyboard before I learned how to hand-write it. I still remember an amber monochrome CRT monitor where I used to play old video games.<br/>
        I started using Windows when you should type the command "win" in DOS, a little time before it became <strike>an auto launch program that invade and conquer all computers</strike> an Operating System.<br/>
        In 2000, the 2YK found me finishing high school... but the world didn't end then.<br/>
        <br/>
        In spite all that, I studied Humanities.<br/>
        To be more specific, I have a degree in Art History and Theory and I'm assistant professor and researcher on Film and Media Studies, both in the Philosophy and Literature School of the Universidad de Buenos Aires. <br/> 
        I also took postgraduate courses in Library and Information Science.<br/>
        I work as a technical assistant in Digitization Project Management in a national cultural institution.<br/>
        <br/>
        So, here I am/we are, trying to deal with the idea (and the making) of Digital Humanities.<br/>

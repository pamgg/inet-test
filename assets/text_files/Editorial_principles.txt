<ref @target @xml:id>
<notes @xml:id> for notes in the source

-----editorial interventions-----------

<corr>
<reg>   

----------images-------------
<graphic @url>


---------maybe not---------------------

<div @type>??? (I try this but it give me problems whith the <p>)
<rs @corresp @ref??>??? (danger!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- In English text we will modernize the "S" Characters

	So, maybe we should use <reg>
	(Agreed. Pam dixit)

- In Spanish text we will adapt it to the printed text published in La revista de Buenos Aires
YES. Maybe we can put a descriptive introduction of the original text (as Nidia present in her lab example). What do you think? Absolutly yes!

- Regularizamos las tildes en la versión castellana? Si. con <reg>? Sí 
- Un detalle menor, los números con millares están separados con , en vez de con . mantendría eso en nuestro texto

Questions:

Are we going to use @ref in <name>?? wich reference? (BNE, VIAF, Geonames?) (and what we are going to do whith that information?)
P: If we want to keep it simple, maybe we should go back to the Wikipedia references. BNE or VIAF seems to me like good options, but it's true, if we choose any of those options, we need to understand why and what for :)
G: Maybe don't use the @ref yet, we can always add it later,   

Are we going to use <rs> (reference strng) for deictics?? / Not?
P: Maybe not. It's more complicated, right? 

Are we going to use <corr> or <sic>? / <sic> for mistakes <reg> for regularizations
P: So, the idea may be not showing the <sic> (mistakes), but showing only reg, right?
G: I think we should show both, but with diferent style options

Are we going to use <div>, and what for? / 
P: we can use to display text, but it's no needed

Where are we going to put the notes (end-page or end-document)? / end page? Agreed (P)

How to visualize elements, colors, italics, bold, etc??
Now we have:
-Names: bold
-Reg: italic (and green color for now)
-Sic: brown color

P: Maybe we can hide the sic and only show reg?
G: I think we should not hide the sic, but make it visible for the reader as an editorial intervention over the mistake in the source
 otherwise it is just a transcription (and if that is the case, we should not regularize the spelling)

Title of the site, time for a change?
P: Agreed (not sure wich title could be "suitable"... maybe: "A Digital Publishing Experience" hahaha)
